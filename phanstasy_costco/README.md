This app was created over the course of a couple of weeks as a final project for the Devmountain bootcamp.

This app was built as an ecomerce site for DnD players. The intention being that a Dungeon Master could fill the store with items they liked, making it easier and more fun for players to shop around.
It is also a handy demonstration of my knowledge of full stack development! This app includes user authorization with the help of Bcrypt, password resetting functionality with the help of NodeMailer, and styles done completely with the use of Sass.
